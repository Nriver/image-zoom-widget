# Hints

# Why I Made This?

In Trilium Notes, images are an essential part of organizing visual content. However, Trilium lacks a native zoom feature for images, which can make it difficult to view details in high-resolution images. To enhance the image viewing experience, I created this plugin to provide smooth zooming, dragging, and closing functionalities.

I wanted to make it easier for users to interact with images directly within their notes without the need for external viewers or clunky workarounds.

This plugin is especially useful for people who regularly work with images in Trilium and want a more dynamic way to explore their content.
